Sharp-Html (SH) is a C# library to help those of us who are writing quick and dirty reports or other text based "stuff" in C# and need to display that "stuff" in Htm. Specifically if you use a lot of tables **_especially identical tables_** SH allows you to create table templates that you can use over and over, without having to keep redefining them.
